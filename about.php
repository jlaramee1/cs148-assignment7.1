<h1>The History of our Practice</h1>
<p>Sonotone of Burlington has been serving the hearing needs of the Champlain 
Valley for more than ___ years.  We are independently, family owned and operated.
  The late Norman Clark was part of the hearing aid industry for over many years 
	in a variety of capacities.  He worked for both Sonotone International and 
	Danavox Hearing Instruments in marketing and sales.  He also was a member and 
	chairman of the Committee on Ethics for the Hearing Industry Association for 
	a number of years in the early 70's.  He then went on to serve the hearing 
	impaired by taking on the role of the traditional hearing aid dispenser.  
	His strive to stay abreast of new technologies and keep his patients informed 
	of ongoing advancements in the hearing aid industry were an essential part of 
	his success.

<p>
These same traits and ideals were passed on to his daughter, Nancy Clark-Laramee.
  She pursued the Audiology degree so that she may also have the same positive 
	impact with the hearing impaired population they served.  Graduating from the 
	University of Vermont with a Bacholer of Arts in Communication Science and 
	Disorders, and then SUNY Plattsburgh with a Master of Arts in Audiology in 
	1989.  Working in tandem for many years before Norman's retirement she was 
	able to benefit from his wealth of practical knowledge and expertise.

<p>
Following Norman's retirement, Nancy is continuing to serve the hearing 
impaired with the same professionalism and genuine caring that her father 
had graciously modeled for her.  She continues to stay informed of the latest 
developments in the field, incorporating them into the practice as is appropriate.  
With the onset of the digital age, the hearing aid industry has seen a multitude 
of changes and it is our goal to stay informed so that we may be able to provide 
the best solution to help improve an individual's hearing ability.
